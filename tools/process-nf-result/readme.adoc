= NextFlow Result Processor

Script to process the result directory of a NextFlow execution.

This tool does the following:

. Attempts to determine the actual exit code of the script executed by NextFlow,
  as NextFlow swallows script exit codes, only emitting them in log output.
. Dumps the stdout and stderr from script executions to stderr.
. Exits with the same exit code as the failing NextFlow script if the NextFlow
  workflow failed.

This script must be executed in the same working directory as NextFlow.

== Optional Flags

`--verbose`::
Prints out the stdout and stderr of all scripts executed as part of a NextFlow
workflow regardless of the workflow exit status.
